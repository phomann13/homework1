What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

A merge takes information from a seperate version history and brings it into your current local files.
This can often result in merge conflicts which must be fixed before pushing or editing your code

A rebase updates the start of your branch to a later commit that happend after you branched out

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a repo hosted somewhere other than your local computer (On the internet, typically Github)
All code is pushed to your remote repo, allowing multiple people to work on the same code from anywhere.
Additionally, all code is pulled from the remote repo to recheive changes in code pushed by other people.
